This application is built using the Spring Java framework. It is in development road so it runs on localhost port 8080. It also connected to a MySQL database running on localhost port 3306. The majority of the logic is found in BrewMe/src. There is a main folder as well as a test folder. In the test folder I have tests for all of my currently running endpoints, split up by which controller they are found in. In this release I focused on fleshing out my testing methodology as well increasing security on all of my endpoints. Admins, Reviewers, and Brewers all have very specific permissions. In addition to this I added a feature where an admin can export beer data from the database to a file on their machine, as well as upload that same file to the system in the event of data loss or some other event. I can send the latest jar file as well if you'd like to take another shot at runnning the project (too big a file for github). The info for the db can be found at BrewMe/src/main.resources/application.properties.
The security config file used to secure a lot of my endpoints can be found at BrewMe/src/main/java/com.CS622.BrewMe/security/SecurityConfig.java
