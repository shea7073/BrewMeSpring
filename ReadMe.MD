This application is built using the Spring Java framework. It is in development road so it runs on localhost port 8080. It also connected to a MySQL database running on localhost port 3306. The majority of the logic is found in BrewMe/src. There is a main folder as well as a test folder. In the test folder I have tests for all of my currently running endpoints, split up by which controller they are found in. In this release I have done some database work. My app is already very heavily database integrated but within the manualSQL package I developed some addition ways for the developer to interface with the DB. The info for the db can be found at BrewMe/src/main.resources/application.properties as well as within the manualSQL package scripts.
The security config file used to secure a lot of my endpoints can be found at BrewMe/src/main/java/com.CS622.BrewMe/security/SecurityConfig.java
