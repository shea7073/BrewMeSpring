review/text: I wasn't so impressed by this.  Milky and dry in aroma, with some manure/barnyard notes.  Similar flavor profile.  Quite thin, perhaps as expected from the style but in a way that is not comfortable.  (gravity pour at GBBF 2003)

review/text: Cask, GBBF. Medium bodied, strong coffee and caramel flavor. Tastes a bit like baileys cream. Sweet but lots to compensate. Long roasted malt finish. I like it!

review/text: NERAX, Somerville, MA: Cask Sample. A musky sweet aroma. Dark color with a thin head.  It was very delicate.  Layered flavors were subtle and a little hard to pick out (I should have had more than 1/4 pint sample).  Mildly hoppy, with bitter leave.  Well done, especially for such a new brewery.

review/text: Cask (gravity dispense) at Great British Beer Festival, day 4 on 5 August 2011. Dark brown. My god, I can smell the butterscotch as soon as I pick up the glass. I know some people are supposed to be more sensitive to diacetyl than others and that, for some beers, a little is regarded as "appropriate". But this was a butterscotch bomb - fullstop.  Ive had some good beers from these guys but I found this one borderline undrinkable. Surely there must be something wrong here - cant imagine it was supposed to be like this.

review/text: 5th August 2011GBBF. Cask. Cloudy brown beer, no head. Smooth low carbonation palate, semi dry. Caramel malt with mild orange hop. Semi dry finish with a malty aftertaste. Actually enquired if this was mislabelled but it wasnt - the cask label confirmed it. An odd beer - possibly suffered some in transit.

review/text: GraviCask (GBBF2011, Friday)	Woh, what a butterscotch explosion. Taste has simple malter barley and a huge pile of butterscotch. Dont go here unless youre diacetyl-immune.
